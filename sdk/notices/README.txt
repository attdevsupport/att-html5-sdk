AT&T API Platform SDK for HTML5 v4.0
====

The AT&T API Platform SDK for HTML5 is designed to provide an easy way to
develop web applications that can access the AT&T APIs using JavaScript. The
HTML5 experience for AT&T developers focuses on an enhanced capability to
leverage the AT&T RESTful APIs to create feature-rich apps. Access to services
like SMS, in conjunction with the ability to enable direct
carrier billing, provides a multitude of options not normally available to
mobile web application developers.
