      <h3>What is the AT&T API Platform SDK for HTML5?</h3>
      <p>The AT&T API Platform SDK for HTML5 is designed to provide an easy way to develop Web applications that can access the AT&T APIs using JavaScript. The HTML5 experience for AT&T developers focuses on an enhanced capability to leverage the AT&T network-based services to create feature-rich apps. Access to services like SMS and Speech-to-Text, in conjunction with the ability to enable direct carrier billing, provides a multitude of options not normally available to mobile Web application developers.</p>

      <h3>Dependencies</h3>
        <p>This SDK provides a framework-neutral library (att-api-client.js) for accessing the AT&T services.  However, all the sample applications require <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/" target="_blank">Sencha Touch</a> (version 2.3.1 or later). After agreeing to the Sencha software license, download the Sencha Touch and copy the following files into the <code>webcontent/lib</code> folder:</p>
    <br>
        <p><code>sencha-touch-all.js</code></p>
        <p><code>sencha-touch.css</code></p>
    <br>
    <p>If you choose to run the Java variant of the included SDK server, you must recompile it so that the resulting .war file includes the Sencha Touch files listed above.</p>
