# AT&T HTML5 SDK

-----------

## Introduction

The AT&T HTML5 SDK provides an HTML5 framework for calling the AT&T API 
Platform.

## SDK Contents

Each release consists of two ZIP files: one containing the SDK source code, and 
the other with the SDK documentation. Please refer to the 
[SDK Filename Format](#sdk-filename-format) section below for more details on 
the ZIP filenames. Please refer to the [Building The SDK](#building-the-sdk) 
section below for instructions describing how you can build the SDK yourself.

- **SDK Documentation** Located at <code>doc</code> folder
- **JavaScript client library** <code>att-api-client.js</code> 
- **Java Server Code** Java server side including:
    - Source code: <code>server/java/src</code>
    - Distributable war and jar files: <code>server/java/dist</code>
    - Documentation: <code>server/java/docs</code>  
- **PHP Server code** 
    - Source: <code>server/php/public_html</code>
    - Documentation: <code>server/php/docs</code>
- **Ruby Server code** 
    - Source: <code>server/ruby</code>
    - Documentation: <code>server/ruby/docs</code>
- **Standalone Sample Apps** Located at <code>webcontent</code>
- **License**

## Consuming the SDK

If you want to use the SDK, please unpack the associated ZIP files and read the 
documentation in the doc ZIP. The remainder of the instructions below are 
intended for developers who are modifying or updating the SDK.

## The SDK Developer's Quick-Start

The checked-in source tree represents a working deployment of the SDK. After 
installing the prerequisite Ruby software described below, you can run the 
samples app server:

    sdk/server/ruby/att> ruby app.rb

and

    sdk/server/ruby/att> ruby listener.rb
    
And then you can view the samples by navigating a Chrome browser to:

    http://localhost:4567

You can also alternatively run the Java or PHP server, after setting up their 
associated prerequisites.
    
## Installing Ruby 1.9.3 on Mac OSX

1. It is wise to install rvm first. Start by opening up terminal and running 
this command: 

    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

2. After the installation of rvm run the following command: 

    rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p484

3. Make Ruby 1.9.3 default by running 'rvm --default ruby-1.9.3


## Installing the Sinatra Web Server

The following instructions apply to both the Virtual Box Environment and any 
Windows environment you are using to test the SDK code.

1. You will need the 1.9.3 or later version of Ruby.

2. To install any rubyGem, the syntax is:

    <code>gem install gemNameHere</code>

3. So installing sinatra is almost as simple as:

    <code>gem install sinatra</code>
    
    except that you may need to look at any error messages to install missing 
    components or dependent gems. The messages are not exactly friendly. 
    
    Please note that in order to use jsduck on Java and PHP, we require an older
    version of the tool, which can be installed with:
    
    <code>gem install -v 3.11.2 jsduck</code>
    
    Common gems that will be used to run this project are:

    - jsduck version 3.11.2
    - yard
    - thin
    - crack
    - mechanize
    - uuid
    - immutable_struct
    - rest-client

    One thing that helps is that if you get the rubyGem name approximately 
    right, the gem install will often suggest an alternative after a long pause, 
    which usually is correct. 

## SDK Filename Format
The name convention we are using, as per AT&T request, is the following:

SDK source code: <code>HTML5SDK-RMAJOR.MINOR-DATE.zip</code>
SDK documentation: <code>HTML5SDK-RMAJOR.MINOR.doc-DATE.zip</code>

Where:
    
- MAJOR is the SDK major version.  
- MINOR is the SDK minor version.
- DATE is the formatted date (yyyyMMddHHmm) to identify the build.

The sdk.version values are configured in the package.properties file.

## Packaging The SDK

The SDK is produced by executing the following script on sdk folder:

  <code>sdk# ./package.sh</code>

Although the packaging process should not place any unnecessary generated files 
in the release ZIP files, you may find it useful to run 
<code>git clean -fdx</code> before packaging, just to be sure.  

This script will compile and package all server side languages and samples. The 
generated files will be placed on the root folder of the project. One ZIP file 
will be created for the SDK development material, and a second ZIP file will be 
created for the SDK documentation.

Troubleshooting tip: If the package.sh script doesn't run, check the file's 
execution settings; you can enable the execute bit with:

    chmod +x package.sh

The packaging process has a number of dependencies you will need to set up in 
advance, as described below:

## Setting up a Build Environment

Note that the build process for this project was originally set up to run in a 
Linux environment; for best results we recommend doing the same. The free 
product [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) can be used to 
set up a Linux virtual machine.

1. Install the java, including the JDK. Either the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK will 
work just fine. 

2. You must have the JAVA\_HOME environment variable pointing to the correct 
location for the scripts to work. Type <code>echo $JAVA\_HOME</code> at the Bash 
Terminal prompt, and if nothing happens, the variable has not been set. It 
should be set to the root of your Java installation, and 
<code>$JAVA\_HOME/bin</code> should be in your <code>$PATH</code>.

3. Install Ruby; the latest version in the 1.9.x series currently is the most 
likely not to cause problems. (The dependent Ruby libraries are all present and 
reliable for 1.9.3.) Please refer to the documentation packaged with the SDK; it 
contains detailed instructions for installing the required Ruby components. This 
documentation is checked in at 
<code>sdk/doc_src/guides/server_ruby_env/README.md</code>, but the HTML version 
included in the SDK is more legible.

4. Install the Ant build tool, 
[using Ant web site instructions](https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html).

5. Install the JSDuck documentation tool. This is a Ruby gem that can be 
installed using the command below. If Ruby is installed as admin, you may need 
to prefix that command with 'sudo'. *NOTE* You _must_ install the older version 
of JSDuck listed below - the tool removed support for documenting non-JavaScript 
source code in more recent versions.

  * <code>gem install -v 3.11.2 jsduck</code>
